WooRocks Magic Content for Siteorigins Page Builder lets you control output of content created inside Siteorigins Page Builder Rows using criterias like User has to be logged in or member of a certain role in WordPress to view the section.

== Description ==

** Due to loads of work I will have no time updating this plugin until october **

Magic Content by WooRocks is a lightweight and powerful add-on that allows you to take control of your websiteâ€™s content by
restricting access to sections to logged in users, specific user roles or to logged out users.

You don't have to use any kind of shortcodes using this plugin. Just install Siteorigins Page Builder and this plugin and you are all set.

*   Choose if a section will be visible for logged in / logged out users only.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for logged in users that are members of a choosen role in Wordpress.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for users from a specific country with two letter countrycodes.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for users from a specific region.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for users from a specific city.
*   You can NOT combine countries like SE, NO in this version.

You will have to assign rows both country and region or country or city if using GEO locations for them to work properly!

This is the first version of the plugin and we will add more features to it soon. The more people that uses it and spreads the word
about it the more time we will invest in developing it further.

We are also working on a PRO version fully packed with other features for the Siteorigins Page Builder Plugin.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/woorocks-magic-content-for-pagebuilder` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Startup the Siteorigins Page Builder and edit a page.
4. Select a row element and under Attributes you will find Magic Content..

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with any other page builders =

YES, it works with Elementor Page Builder but you need to download and install that particular version.

= Does it affect some other plugins =

Not that we are aware of, we have tested it with several of the known memberships plugins without trouble.

== Screenshots ==

1. Here you can see that we have just choosen to show this section to users that are logged out, also called visitors.

2. We can choose if the users need to be logged in or logged out.

3. We can also choose from all the built in standard user roles in the system. Just choose the role in your sections and they are protected.

4. Here you can see that we can also alter several sections on one page. So with Magic Content you can choose to have different restrictions
 on several parts of your pages.

5. This demosection is only displayed for users inside the role subscriber.

6. From version 1.0.5 you can also set GEO filters for country, region and city as the screenshot shows you. This way you can protect your content in Wordpress by country, region and city.
